This is a demo how to build an iOS app communicate with security APIs backend nodejs/mongodb. The iOS app is simple to-do app, it will allow user signup/signin, create tasks with image, and delete tasks. The backend built an authentication service, using bcrypt to hash password with salt and store hashed password in mongodb, using jwt-simple to generate json web token response to client after user signin/signup successfully. In client app, only requests with valid token will be authorized to process, otherwise request is denied. The backend will create signed url for client app to upload image onto AWS S3. This also demo how to use express router, passport-jwt to build APIs with authentication mechanism more clearly, better organized.
